Working with Yelp dataset sample

In the graded quiz assignment we will first run the script that was presented the video, and then we will add commands to answer a few more questions, The details for adding commands are in the quiz. Here are the comments for running the attached pig script below.

1. Check out the Yelp dataset in your cloudera VM:

Try this in Unix

unix > head -1 /usr/lib/hue/apps/search/examples/collections/solr_configs_yelp_demo/index_data.csv

(it returns the header row)

2. Copy the dataset into HDFS if you are going to run pig -x mapreduce

unix> hdfs dfs -copyFromLocal /usr/lib/hue/apps/search/examples/collections/solr_configs_yelp_demo/index_data.csv /user/cloudera/input/yelp_data.csv

3. At unix prompt enter:

unix > pig -x local or enter pig -x mapreduce

4. Note on Pig commands: after any command you could try

grunt> DESCRIBE relation-name-you-use to see what the schema that Pig is using for the relation.

It is very useful as you debug and develop scripts, especially to get the field referencing correct
