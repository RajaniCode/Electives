1.7 Displaying the Image Name

Our RecipeActivity layout has a single TextView with ID text_view_name. Let’s set that TextViews’s text to the name of the selected image we just passed in with the Intent. We went ahead and got the Intent already and created a String variable imageName.

RecipeActivity.java
package com.codeschool.tinybytes;

import android.content.Intent;
import android.support.v7.app.AppCompatActivity;
import android.os.Bundle;
import android.widget.TextView;

public class RecipeActivity extends AppCompatActivity {

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_recipe);

        Intent intent = this.getIntent();
        String imageName = "";
        
    }
}


1. Get the name of the selected image with the getStringExtra() method. (remember the key we used was "image_name")

Set the result equal to the String imageName we already created.

Answer:
RecipeActivity.java

2. Add an if check to see if the intent actually has the "image_name" key before calling getStringExtra().
