4.3 Creating a RecipeDbHelper Class

We need a RecipeDbHelper class to manage our database. We went ahead and created the class, but we still need to fill in the onCreate and onUpgrade methods.

RecipeDbHelper.java
package com.codeschool.tinybytes;

import android.content.Context;
import android.database.sqlite.SQLiteDatabase;
import android.database.sqlite.SQLiteOpenHelper;

public class RecipeDbHelper extends SQLiteOpenHelper {
    public RecipeDbHelper(Context context) {
        super(context, RecipeContract.DB_NAME,
              null, RecipeContract.DB_VERSION);
    }

    @Override
    public void onCreate(SQLiteDatabase db){
        
    }

    @Override
    public void onUpgrade(SQLiteDatabase db, 
                          int oldVersion, int newVersion){
        
    }
}


1. In the onCreate method, we want to call the execSQL method on the db database parameter that's passed in. As an argument to this call, we want to execute the SQL_CREATE_ENTRIES statement we created earlier in the RecipeContract class. That can be accessed with RecipeContract.SQL_CREATE_ENTRIES.

Answer:
RecipeDbHelper.java

2. In the onUpgrade method, we want to first execute the SQL command to delete the table which is the SQL_DELETE_ENTRIES statement we created in the RecipeContract class.

Answer:
RecipeDbHelper.java

3. In the onUpgrade method, after we delete the table we want to create a new one by calling the onCreate() method and passing in the database variable, db.

Answer:
RecipeDbHelper.java
