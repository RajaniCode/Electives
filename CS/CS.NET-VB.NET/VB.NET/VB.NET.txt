A Static variable in VB.NET is a local variable that retains its value between method calls.


Methods (Subroutines, Functions) cannot be Static, however, can be Shared

Subroutines cannot return


Functions can return:

Private [Shared] Function myFunction() [As String]
    Return "String"
End Function

Private Shared Function myFunction() [As String]
    myFunction = "String"
End Function


[Shared] Methods can have its Form controls 
ONLY USING the Form controls' [Object]
[Note: Result will not be as sama as Shared]


[Shared] Event Subroutines can call [Non Shared] Methods (Subroutines, Functions)
ONLY USING the Methods' [Object] 
[Note: Result will not be as sama as Shared]


[Non Shared] Event Subroutines can call [Shared/Non Shared] Methods (Subroutines, Functions)
[Note: if in the same class [Class/Object] prefixes are not required]
