Sign an Assembly with a Strong Name

1. Create an assembly

//Sample.cs
namespace Mathematics
{
    class Maths
    {
	public int IntegerSquare(int Number)
        {
	    return Number * Number;	   
        }	
    }
}

2. Create sample dll and sample module

//The /target:library option causes the compiler to create a dynamic-link library (DLL) rather than an executable file (EXE).
>csc /t:library Sample.cs

//This option causes the compiler to not generate an assembly manifest.
//A file that does not have an assembly manifest cannot be loaded by the .NET Framework common language runtime. 
//However, such a file can be incorporated into the assembly manifest of an assembly by means of /addmodule.
>csc /t:modlue Sample.cs


3. The Strong Name tool (Sn.exe) helps sign assemblies with strong names. Sn.exe provides options for key management, signature generation, and signature verification.

//The Strong Name tool is automatically installed with Visual Studio. To start the tool, use the Visual Studio and Windows SDK Command Prompts. 


The following command creates a new, random key pair and stores it in keyPair.snk.

sn -k keyPair.snk


4. Sign an Assembly with a Strong Name - Using the Assembly Linker (Al.exe) provided by the Windows SDK

>al /out:Sample.dll Sample.netmodule /keyfile:keyPair.snk


5. Sign an Assembly with a Strong Name - Using Attribute

/*
In a code module, add the AssemblyKeyFileAttribute or the AssemblyKeyNameAttribute, specifying the name of the file or container that contains the key pair to use when signing the assembly with a strong name.

The following code example uses the AssemblyKeyFileAttribute with a key file called keyPair.snk, located in the directory where the assembly is compiled.
*/

//SampleUsingAttribute.cs
[assembly:AssemblyKeyFileAttribute("keyPair.snk")]
namespace Mathematics
{  
    class Maths
    {
	public int IntegerSquare(int Number)
        {
	    return Number * Number;	   
        }	
    }
}


sn -vf SampleUsingAttribute.dll

sn -v SampleUsingAttribute.dll
