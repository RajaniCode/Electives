To sign an assembly with a strong name, you must have a public/private key pair. This public and private cryptographic key pair is used during compilation to create a strong-named assembly. You can create a key pair using the Strong Name tool (Sn.exe). Key pair files usually have an .snk extension.

To create a key pair

At the command prompt, type the following command: 

sn –k <file name> 

In this command, file name is the name of the output file containing the key pair. 


The following example creates a key pair called sgKey.snk.

sn -k sgKey.snk
 
If you intend to delay sign an assembly and you control the whole key pair (which is unlikely outside test scenarios), you can use the following commands to generate a key pair and then extract the public key from it into a separate file. First, create the key pair:

sn -k keypair.snk
 
Next, extract the public key from the key pair and copy it to a separate file:


sn -p keypair.snk public.snk
 
Once you create the key pair, you must put the file where the strong name signing tools can find it
