3.1 Working with the Console

Print the string "I can't wait to run my 5K" to the console.

Find the element with an ID of "events" and log it to the console.

We've implemented a Calendar.countEvents() method that returns the number of events in the list. Call the method from the console to see that it works.

Assert that Calendar.countEvents() returns a value of 3. We expect this assertion to be true, so it shouldn't raise an exception.

Now print the warning message "Watch out!" to the console.


F12
Console
console.log("I can't wait to run my 5K");

console.log(document.getElementById("events"));

Calendar.countEvents();

console.assert(Calendar.countEvents() == 3);

console.warn("Watch out!");
