1.2 Calculating Investment

Let’s write a simple function that calculates how much money we've made from our recent investment of $1,000.00 at a 0.01% rate of return.

account.exs

amount = Account.investment_return(1000, 0.0001)
IO.puts "Investment return: $#{amount}"

1. Define a new module named Account.

Answer:
account.exs

defmodule Account do
end

amount = Account.investment_return(1000, 0.0001)
IO.puts "Investment return: $#{amount}"


2. Inside the new module, define a function named investment_return. This function should accept two arguments: initial and interest.

Answer:
account.exs

defmodule Account do
 def investment_return(initial, interest) do
 end
end

amount = Account.investment_return(1000, 0.0001)
IO.puts "Investment return: $#{amount}"


3. Fill in the body of the function with the following operation: initial + (initial * interest)

Answer:
account.exs

defmodule Account do
 def investment_return(initial, interest) do
  initial + (initial * interest)
 end
end

amount = Account.investment_return(1000, 0.0001)
IO.puts "Investment return: $#{amount}"
