2.2 Piping Strings

In Elixir, we can pipe strings to functions like this:

"Some string" |> SomeModule.some_function
In this challenge, we'll use the string "Elixir" with the String.upcase function from Elixir's standard library, which takes a string and converts its characters to uppercase.

string.exs
IO.puts String.upcase("Elixir")

Change the following code snippet to use the pipe operator |> twice.

Answer:
string.exs
"Elixir" |> String.upcase |> IO.puts
