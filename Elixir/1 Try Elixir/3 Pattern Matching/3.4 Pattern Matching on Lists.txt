3.4 Pattern Matching on Lists

Let's use pattern matching to read individual elements from a list.

withdrawals.exs

withdrawals = [50.0, 60.75, 12.0]

            = withdrawals

IO.puts "Gym: $#{gym}, Cell Phone: $#{cell_phone}, Netflix: $#{netflix}"


Use pattern matching to read the individual elements from the withdrawals list so the code runs properly and prints the following text to the console:

Gym: $50.0, Cell Phone: $60.75, Netflix: $12.0


Answer:
withdrawals.exs

withdrawals = [50.0, 60.75, 12.0]

[gym, cell_phone, netflix] = withdrawals

IO.puts "Gym: $#{gym}, Cell Phone: $#{cell_phone}, Netflix: $#{netflix}"
