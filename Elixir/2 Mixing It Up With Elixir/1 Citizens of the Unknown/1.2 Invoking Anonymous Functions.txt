1.2 Invoking Anonymous Functions

In the following code, we define an anonymous function and assign it to a variable called print_name. Let's finish writing this code.

script.exs

print_name = fn(name) -> IO.puts "Hello, I am #{name}" end


On the second line, invoke the anonymous function assigned to the variable and pass your own name as a string argument to it.

Answer:
script.exs

print_name = fn(name) -> IO.puts "Hello, I am #{name}" end
print_name.("Elixir")
