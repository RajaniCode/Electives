5.3 Calculating Expenses

Inside the lib/expenses.ex file, let’s define the first function of our new project.

expenses.ex

defmodule Expenses do
  

end


1. Define a new function called current_balance. This function should accept two arguments: initial and spending.

Answer:
expenses.ex

defmodule Expenses do
  def current_balance(initial, spending) do
  end
end

2. From inside current_balance, return the subtraction of spending from initial.

Answer:
expenses.ex

defmodule Expenses do
  def current_balance(initial, spending) do
    initial - spending
  end
end
