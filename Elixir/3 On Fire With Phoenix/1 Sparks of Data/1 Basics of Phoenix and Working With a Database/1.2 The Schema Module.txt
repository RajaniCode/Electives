1.2 The Schema Module

The Phoenix application we’ll be coding in these challenges is called Neon. This app will help us keep track of events happening all over the country. Let’s start by creating a new Schema module responsible for mapping Phoenix code to a database table called “events”

lib/neon/event.ex
defmodule  do
  use Ecto.Schema

  schema "events" do
    
  end
end


1. Define the name of the module. Remember, the name of the module starts with the name of the application

Answer:
lib/neon/event.ex

2. Inside the do/end block, define fields for :name, :location, and :start_on. The first two should be of type :string and the last one should be of type :naive_datetime.

Answer: 
lib/neon/event.ex

3. Still inside do/end, call the function that maps to columns that help keep track of when a record was initially inserted and when it was last updated.

Answer:
lib/neon/event.ex
