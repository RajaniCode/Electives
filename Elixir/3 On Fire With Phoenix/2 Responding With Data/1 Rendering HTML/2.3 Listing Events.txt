2.3 Listing Events

We want to start listing events on a page. The first step is to create a route that maps the root URL path to a controller and action. Then, from the action, weâ€™ll start by responding with plain text.

lib/neon_web/router.ex
defmodule NeonWeb.Router do
  use NeonWeb, :router

  pipeline :browser do
    plug :accepts, ["html"]
    plug :fetch_session
    plug :fetch_flash
    plug :protect_from_forgery
    # plug :put_secure_browser_headers
  end

  pipeline :api do
    plug :accepts, ["json"]
  end

  scope "/", NeonWeb do
    pipe_through :browser

    
  end
end


1. In router.ex, add a new GET route, mapping "/" to the EventController module and :index action.

Answer:
lib/neon_web/router.ex

2. Now switch to the lib/neon_web/controllers/event_controller.ex file and define the index action. This action takes two parameters. Name the first one conn, and make sure the second argument is ignored by the Elixir compiler.

Answer: 
lib/neon_web/router.ex

3. Using the text() function, return the string "Events" from the index action. Remember to use conn as the first argument to text().
