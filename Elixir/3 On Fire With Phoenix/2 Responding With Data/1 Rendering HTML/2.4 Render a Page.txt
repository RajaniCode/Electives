2.4 Render a Page

Responding with text is a good first step. However, our goal is to render an HTML page. Letâ€™s change our controller code to do just that.

lib/neon_web/controllers/event_controller.ex
defmodule NeonWeb.EventController do
  use NeonWeb, :controller

  
  

  def index(conn, _) do
    
    
  end
end


1. First, in order to facilitate working with Repo and Event, create two aliases for these modules.

Answer:
lib/neon_web/controllers/event_controller.ex

2. Inside index, fetch all events from the database and assign them to a variable called events.

Answer: 
lib/neon_web/controllers/event_controller.ex

3. Call the render() function so that it uses the "index.html" template. The template should receive a keyword list with the events variable assigned to a key with the same name.
