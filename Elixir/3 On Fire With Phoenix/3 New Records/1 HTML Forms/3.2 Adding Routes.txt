3.2 Adding Routes

Letâ€™s add the ability to create new events from the web app, starting with the routes file.

lib/neon_web/router.ex
defmodule NeonWeb.Router do
  use NeonWeb, :router

  pipeline :browser do
    plug :accepts, ["html"]
    plug :fetch_session
    plug :fetch_flash
    plug :protect_from_forgery
    plug :put_secure_browser_headers
  end

  pipeline :api do
    plug :accepts, ["json"]
  end
  
  scope "/", NeonWeb do
    pipe_through :browser

    get "/", EventController, :index

    
    
  end
end
