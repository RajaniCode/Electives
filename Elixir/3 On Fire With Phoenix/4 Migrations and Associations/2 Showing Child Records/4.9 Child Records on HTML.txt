4.9 Child Records on HTML

We’ve added code to EventController so it’s successfully setting up data for the "show.html" template. Now, from this template, let’s add the section which lists comments for the event.

lib/neon_web/templates/event/show.html.eex
<h2><%= @event.name %></h2>

<p>Location: <%= @event.location %></p>
<p>Date: <%= format_date(@event.start_on) %></p>

<ul>
  <%= for  do %>
  	
  <% end %>
</ul>

Answer:
lib/neon_web/templates/event/show.html.eex
