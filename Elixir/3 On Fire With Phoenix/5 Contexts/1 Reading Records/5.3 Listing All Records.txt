5.3 Listing All Records

In order to avoid tight coupling, we’ve started a new context module called Calendar. Let’s finish coding the features for listing all events and selecting an event by its id.

lib/neon/calendar/calendar.ex
defmodule Neon.Calendar do

  alias Neon.Repo
  alias Neon.Calendar.Event

  def list_events do
    
  end

  def get_event(id) do
    
  end
end


1. In the list_events function, write the code that returns all events from the "events" database table.

Answer:
lib/neon/calendar/calendar.ex

2. In get_event(), write the code that gets an event by its id. Remember, we must also preload its comments.
