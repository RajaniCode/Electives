5.6 The Changeset

Time to refactor the code which creates new events. The first step is rendering the 

lib/neon/calendar/event.ex
defmodule Neon.Calendar.Event do
  use Ecto.Schema

  alias Neon.Calendar.Comment
  


  schema "events" do
    field :name, :string
    field :location, :string
    field :start_on, :naive_datetime

    has_many :comments, Comment

    timestamps()
  end

  def changeset(%Event{} = event, attrs) do
    event
    |> cast(attrs, [  ])
  end
end


1. Import the module which holds the cast() function, used by the changeset function.

Answer:
lib/neon/calendar/event.ex

2. Create an alias which will allow us to refer to the Neon.Calendar.Event module from inside its changeset function as simply Event.

Answer: 
lib/neon/calendar/event.ex

3. Complete the call to the cast function inside changeset, passing it the proper list of attributes.

Answer:
lib/neon/calendar/event.ex
