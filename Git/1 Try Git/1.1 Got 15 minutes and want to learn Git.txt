1.1 Got 15 minutes and want to learn Git?

Git allows groups of people to work on the same documents (often code) at the same time, and without stepping on each other's toes. It's a distributed version control system.

Our terminal prompt below is currently in a directory we decided to name "octobox". To initialize a Git repository here, type the following command:

git init


Press enter to submit commands

> git init

Initialized empty Git repository in /.git/

Success!


My Octobox Repository

    .git
