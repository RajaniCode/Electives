1.10 Remote Repositories

Great job! We've gone ahead and created a new empty GitHub repository for you to use with Try Git at https://github.com/try-git/try_git.git. To push our local repo to the GitHub server we'll need to add a remote repository.

This command takes a remote name and a repository URL, which in your case is https://github.com/try-git/try_git.git.

Go ahead and run git remote add with the options below:

git remote add origin https://github.com/try-git/try_git.git


Press enter to submit commands


$ git remote add origin https://github.com/try-git/try_git.git

 
Success!
