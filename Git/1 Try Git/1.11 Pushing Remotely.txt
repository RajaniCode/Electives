1.11 Pushing Remotely

The push command tells Git where to put our commits when we're ready, and boy we're ready. So let's push our local changes to our origin repo (on GitHub).

The name of our remote is origin and the default local branch name is master. The -u tells Git to remember the parameters, so that next time we can simply run git push and Git will know what to do. Go ahead and push it!

git push -u origin master


Press enter to submit commands

 
$ git push -u origin master
 

Branch master set up to track remote branch master from origin.

Success!
