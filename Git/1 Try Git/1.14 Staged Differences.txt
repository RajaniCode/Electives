1.14 Staged Differences

Another great use for diff is looking at changes within files that have already been staged. Remember, staged files are files we have told git that are ready to be committed.

Let's use git add to stage octofamily/octodog.txt, which I just added to the family for you.

git add octofamily/octodog.txt


Press enter to submit commands


$ git add octofamily/octodog.txt


Success!
