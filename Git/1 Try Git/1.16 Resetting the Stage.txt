1.16 Resetting the Stage

So now that octodog is part of the family, octocat is all depressed. Since we love octocat more than octodog, we'll turn his frown around by removing octodog.txt.

You can unstage files by using the git reset command. Go ahead and remove octofamily/octodog.txt.

git reset octofamily/octodog.txt


Press enter to submit commands


$ git reset octofamily/octodog.txt


Success!
