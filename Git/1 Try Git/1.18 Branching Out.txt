1.18 Branching Out

When developers are working on a feature or bug they'll often create a copy (aka. branch) of their code they can make separate commits to. Then when they're done they can merge this branch back into their main master branch.

We want to remove all these pesky octocats, so let's create a branch called clean_up, where we'll do all the work:

git branch clean_up


Press enter to submit commands

$ git branch clean_up

Success!
