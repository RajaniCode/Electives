1.19 Switching Branches

Great! Now if you type git branch you'll see two local branches: a main branch named master and your new branch named clean_up.

You can switch branches using the git checkout <branch> command. Try it now to switch to the clean_up branch:

git checkout clean_up


Press enter to submit commands


$ git checkout clean_up


Switched to branch 'clean_up'

Success!
