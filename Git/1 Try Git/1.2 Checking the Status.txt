1.2 Checking the Status

Good job! As Git just told us, our "octobox" directory now has an empty repository in /.git/. The repository is a hidden directory where Git operates.

To save your progress as you go through this tutorial -- and earn a badge when you successfully complete it -- head over to create a free Code School account. We'll wait for you here.

Next up, let's type the git status command to see what the current state of our project is:

git status


Press enter to submit commands
 
$ git status

# On branch master
#
# Initial commit
#
nothing to commit (create/copy files and use "git add" to track)

Success!
