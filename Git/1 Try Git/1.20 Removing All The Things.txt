1.20 Removing All The Things

Ok, so you're in the clean_up branch. You can finally remove all those pesky octocats by using the git rm command which will not only remove the actual files from disk, but will also stage the removal of the files for us.

You're going to want to use a wildcard again to get all the octocats in one sweep, go ahead and run:

git rm '*.txt'


Press enter to submit commands


$ git rm '*.txt'


rm 'blue_octocat.txt'
rm 'octocat.txt'
rm 'octofamily/baby_octocat.txt'
rm 'octofamily/momma_octocat.txt'
rm 'red_octocat.txt'

Success!
