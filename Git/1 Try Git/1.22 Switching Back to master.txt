1.22 Switching Back to master

Great, you're almost finished with the cat... er the bug fix, you just need to switch back to the master branch so you can copy (or merge) your changes from the clean_up branch back into the master branch.

Go ahead and checkout the master branch:

git checkout master


Press enter to submit commands

$ git checkout master

Switched to branch 'master'

Success!
