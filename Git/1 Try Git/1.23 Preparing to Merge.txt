1.23 Preparing to Merge

Alrighty, the moment has come when you have to merge your changes from the clean_up branch into the master branch. Take a deep breath, it's not that scary.

We're already on the master branch, so we just need to tell Git to merge the clean_up branch into it:

git merge clean_up


Press enter to submit commands


$ git merge clean_up
