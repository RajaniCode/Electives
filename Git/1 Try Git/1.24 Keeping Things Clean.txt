1.24 Keeping Things Clean

Congratulations! You just accomplished your first successful bugfix and merge. All that's left to do is clean up after yourself. Since you're done with the clean_up branch you don't need it anymore.

You can use git branch -d <branch name> to delete a branch. Go ahead and delete the clean_up branch now:

git branch -d clean_up


Press enter to submit commands


$ git branch -d clean_up


Deleted branch clean_up (was ec6888b).

Success!
