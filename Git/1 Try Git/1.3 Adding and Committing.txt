1.3 Adding & Committing

I created a file called octocat.txt in the octobox repository for you (as you can see in the browser below).

You should run the git status command again to see how the repository status has changed:

git status


Press enter to submit commands


> git status


# On branch master
#
# Initial commit
#
# Untracked files:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
#
#	octocat.txt
nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

Success!
