1.4 Adding Changes

Good, it looks like our Git repository is working properly. Notice how Git says octocat.txt is "untracked"? That means Git sees that octocat.txt is a new file.

To tell Git to start tracking changes made to octocat.txt, we first need to add it to the staging area by using git add.

git add octocat.txt


Press enter to submit commands


$ git add octocat.txt


Nice job, you've added octocat.txt to the Staging Area
