1.7 Adding All Changes

Great! You also can use wildcards if you want to add many files of the same type. Notice that I've added a bunch of .txt files into your directory below.

I put some in a directory named "octofamily" and some others ended up in the root of our "octobox" directory. Luckily, we can add all the new files using a wildcard with git add. Don't forget the quotes!

git add '*.txt'


Press enter to submit commands


$ git add '*.txt'


Success!
