1.9 History

So we've made a few commits. Now let's browse them to see what we changed.

Fortunately for us, there's git log. Think of Git's log as a journal that remembers all the changes we've committed so far, in the order we committed them. Try running it now:

git log


Press enter to submit commands

$ git log
