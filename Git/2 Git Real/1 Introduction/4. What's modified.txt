4. What's modified?


Okay, you've created a couple files but you can't remember which needed committing. Use the Git command which will show the state of your files.


$ git status

# On branch master
#
# Initial commit
#
# Untracked files:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
#
#	index.html
nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

Success!
