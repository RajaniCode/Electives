11. Remove commit II


Your co-worker is back, looking sheepish. "Never mind the badgers ad. The client's legal department said that was a liability risk." You'll need to remove the most recent commit, and all its changes.


$ git reset --hard HEAD^

HEAD is now at 3d9a9bc Add main page

Success!
