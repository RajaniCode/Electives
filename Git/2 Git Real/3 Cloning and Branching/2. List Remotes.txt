2. List Remotes


Our repo is cloned locally, but how do we check to a list of our remotes? Lets get a list of all our remotes with a verbose output.


$ git remote -v

origin	https://git@pshop.com/petshop_online/petshop.git (fetch)
origin	https://git@pshop.com/petshop_online/petshop.git (push)

Success!
