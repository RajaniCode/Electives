7. Branch shortcut


The pet shop wants to try selling yet another product line! Let's do this one in a branch in case it gets cancelled like the others. Using a single command, create and check out an octopus branch.


$ git checkout -b octopus

Switched to a new branch 'octopus'

Success!
