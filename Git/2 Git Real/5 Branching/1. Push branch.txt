1. Push branch


A new kind of pet is for sale at the store! Maybe this one will catch on with the public. You've committed your work to the local hamsters branch; now publish this branch in the origin repo.


$ git push origin hamsters

To git@github.com:petstore/awesomepetstore.git
 * [new branch]      hamsters -> hamsters

Success!
