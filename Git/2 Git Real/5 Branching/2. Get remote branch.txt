2. Get remote branch


"git branch -r" does not query the remotes to check for new branches. In order to see a new remote branch you first have to do a fetch or a pull. So retrieve the remote "weasel" branch.


$ git fetch

From https://git@pshop.com/petshop_online/petshop.git
   3cc5dbd..162f5d8  master     -> origin/master
 * [new branch]      weasel     -> origin/weasel

Success!
