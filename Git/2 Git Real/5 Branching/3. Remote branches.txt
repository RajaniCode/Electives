3. Remote branches


Your co-worker said he wants you to look over a new branch on "origin", but he didn't tell you its name. Get a list of remote branches.


$ git remote show origin

* remote origin
  Fetch URL: https://git@pshop.com/petshop_online/petshop.git
  Push  URL: https://git@pshop.com/petshop_online/petshop.git
  HEAD branch (remote HEAD is ambiguous, may be one of the following):
    master
    weasel
  Remote branches:
    master tracked
    weasel tracked
  Local branch configured for 'git pull':
    master merges with remote master
  Local ref configured for 'git push':
    master pushes to master (local out of date)

Success!
