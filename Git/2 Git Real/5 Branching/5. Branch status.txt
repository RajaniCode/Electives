5. Branch status


Wait, did you already pull that branch locally? Check for stale branches that are tracking "origin".


$ git remote show origin


* remote origin
  Fetch URL: https://git@pshop.com/petshop_online/petshop.git
  Push  URL: https://git@pshop.com/petshop_online/petshop.git
  HEAD branch: master
  Remote branch:
    master tracked
  Local branch configured for 'git pull':
    weasel merges with remote weasel
  Local ref configured for 'git push':
    master pushes to master (local out of date)

Success!
