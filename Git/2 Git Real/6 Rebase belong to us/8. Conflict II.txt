8. Conflict II


Now run another rebase to move your commit after the latest fetched one.


$ git rebase


First, rewinding head to replay your work on top of it...
Applying: Added kennel page
Applying: Updated main page
Using index info to reconstruct a base tree...
Falling back to patching base and 3-way merge...
Auto-merging index.html
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in index.html
Failed to merge in the changes.
Patch failed at 0002 Updated main page

When you have resolved this problem run "git rebase --continue".
If you would prefer to skip this patch, instead run "git rebase --skip".
To check out the original branch and stop rebasing run "git rebase --abort".


Success! Well, sort of. There was a conflict you'll need to fix. Type `next` to go to the next challenge to fix it.
