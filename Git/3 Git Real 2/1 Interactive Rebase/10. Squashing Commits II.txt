10. Squashing Commits II


After designating a commit to be squashed, another editor pops up enabling you to set a commit message for the resulting commit. Go ahead and set to: squashed some poodles.


Terminal


# This is a combination of 2 commits.
# The first commit's message is:

Implement poodles

# This is the 2nd commit message:

Add title to poodle page

# Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting
# with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.
# Not currently on any branch.
# Changes to be committed:
#   (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)
#
#       new file:   poodles.txt
#       new file:   unicorns.txt
