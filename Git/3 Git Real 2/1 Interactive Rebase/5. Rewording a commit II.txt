5. Rewording a commit II


After setting the 'reword' command in the interactive rebase editor another editor window has opened up. This is where you actually change the commit message. Go ahead and change the commit message to: Add tests for poodles to be more descriptive.


Terminal
Add tests

# Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting
# with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.
# Not currently on any branch.
# Changes to be committed:
#   (use "git reset HEAD^1 <file>..." to unstage)
#
#       new file:   poodle_spec.txt
