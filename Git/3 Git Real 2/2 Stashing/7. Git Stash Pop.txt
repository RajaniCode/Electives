7. Git Stash Pop


Now that you have the file reset, use the pop command to apply and delete the stash at the same time.


$ git stash pop

# On branch new_feature
# Changes not staged for commit:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
#   (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
#
#	modified:   poodles.rb
#	modified:   unicorn.rb
#
no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
