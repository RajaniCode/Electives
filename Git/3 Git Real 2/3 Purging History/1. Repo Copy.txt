1. Repo Copy


Now you've done it. You accidentally put the company's master password into one of your files. You're beginning to panic because you know that it's pretty hard to delete something forever in git. That's what you really need to do, though, or you're in big trouble. You're going to need to purge the history. First, though, make a copy of your repo in case you mess it up. Make a copy of the poodles repository, and name it whatever you want.


$ git clone poodles poodles-filter

Cloning into 'poodles-filter'...
done.

Success!
