1. Line Endings I


Your company just hired a new developer who works on a Windows computer, and you notice that some files seem to be missing line separators. You realize that the Windows machine is saving files with a different line separator character than the Unix stations. Here on your Unix machine, set your 'git config' variable to convert line endings to the Unix way on commit.


$ git config --global core.autocrlf input

Success!
