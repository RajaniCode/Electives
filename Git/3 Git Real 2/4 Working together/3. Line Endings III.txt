3. Line Endings III


After helping a 3rd Windows developer set up their workstation, you've decided enough is enough. It's time to add a .gitattributes file to handle all these line ending problems. Finish adding the options to the *.bat and *.sh files. Remember, *.bat is a windows file, while *.sh is a unix file.

*     text=auto
*.rb text
*.js text

*.bat text eol=
*.sh text eol=

*.png binary
