1. Submodule


You're in the process of putting together two websites. One is for the Mythical Wildlife Fund: MWF.com. The other site is an adoption site for stray unicorns called unicornrescues.com. Both sites will share code for a JavaScript image gallery along with the associated css. Let's get started by adding a submodule containing the JavaScript at "git@petstore.com:gallery_js.git".


$ git submodule add git@petstore.com:gallery_js.git

Cloning into 'gallery_js'...
done.

Success!
