10. On Demand Alias


Wouldn't it be nice if you didn't have to type that long line out every time you wanted to push this project? Let's make the command easier to use. Create an alias which will run the git push --recurse-submodules=on-demand command. Name the alias anything you want.


$ git config alias.pushall "push --recurse-submodules=on-demand"

Success!
