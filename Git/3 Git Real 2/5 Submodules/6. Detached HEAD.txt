6. Detached HEAD


You've just committed a few changes to the gallery_css submodule. When you go to push, you realize that you're in a detached head state. Don't panic, though! We can fix it. Let's start out by creating a new branch with your most recent commit: "a7eded4". Name the branch temp_changes.


$ git branch temp_changes a7eded4

Success!
