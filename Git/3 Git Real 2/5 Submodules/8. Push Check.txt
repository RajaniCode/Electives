8. Push Check


After finishing up a bunch of changes, you want to push them up to the remote so you can share it with your other co-workers that are working on the project. Since you're using submodules, you should make sure to use the option which checks whether you have un-pushed submodules.


$ git push --recurse-submodule=check
