2. Reflog


You realize after the fact that maybe the hard reset was a bit overkill. You still wanted your code used to add rainbow jumps. It's a good thing git never really gets rid of commits. Let's look at the reflog to see if there is anything we can do.


$ git reflog

ab27026 HEAD@{0}: reset: moving to HEAD^
8791492 HEAD@{1}: commit: Rainbow trail when jumping.
ab27026 HEAD@{2}: commit: Implement unicorn jumping.
54e2eee HEAD@{3}: checkout: moving from master to master
54e2eee HEAD@{4}: commit: Add unicorn
f2e4957 HEAD@{5}: commit: Add tests
d245841 HEAD@{6}: commit: Implement poodles
b8ec575 HEAD@{7}: checkout: moving from poodle_implementation to master

71d674e HEAD@{9}: checkout: moving from master to poodle_implementation
b8ec575 HEAD@{10}: commit: Added a title to the homepage
71d674e HEAD@{11}: commit (initial): initial commit

Success!
