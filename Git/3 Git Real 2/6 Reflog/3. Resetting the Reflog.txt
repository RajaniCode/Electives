3. Resetting the Reflog


Great, we can see that there is a log of the reset! Take note of the reflog entry right before your earlier reset. Then do a "hard reset" to that commit to get your work back.


$ git reset --hard HEAD@{1}

HEAD is now at 8791492 Rainbow trail when jumping.

Success!
