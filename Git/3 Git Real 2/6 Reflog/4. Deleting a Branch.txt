4. Deleting a Branch


You decide to clean house a bit. You know that all branches have either been merged or abandoned, so you're going to delete them to keep a tidy repository. Go ahead and get started by deleting the fluffy_poodle branch.


$ git branch -D fluffy_poodle

Deleted branch fluffy_poodle (was aaafb5e).

Success!
