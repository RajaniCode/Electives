1.4 Introduce Yourself

Go to the Deadly Vipers [https://github.com/deadlyvipers] organization on GitHub and look for the "dojo_rules" repository. Follow the tasks below to begin working with this repository.

We'll need to know your GitHub username for this course. We'll assume all changes for this course are done by a GitHub user with this username:


1. Fork the "dojo_rules" repository to your GitHub account. Let us know the GitHub username of the account you forked it to and we'll use that throughout the course. You can change this at anytime, but you probably won't need to.

After you have successfully forked the repo, click "Submit Answer" below.

Answer: pluralschool


2. Make a local clone of your fork of the "dojo_rules" repository. Make sure you don't fork the deadlyvipers version of the repo – clone your fork of it.

Create a new file called introduction.md introducing yourself to the dojo. Make sure this file contains an introduction, then add, commit and push your change to the fork.
