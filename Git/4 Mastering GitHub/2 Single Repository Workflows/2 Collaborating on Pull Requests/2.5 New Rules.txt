2.5 New Rules


There's only so much of git you can learn when you're the only one working in the repository. Why don't we come to your repo and make some commits?

1. The Dojo needs some new rules and we're going to go ahead and start the process. Click "Submit Answer" for us to create a "new_rules" branch on your "dojo_rules" repository and a create new pull request from "new_rules" back to "master". If you already have a "new_rules" branch, we'll go ahead and delete it and recreate it.

Answer: Click "Submit Answer"

2. OK, our files are all committed and pushed up to your "dojo_rules" repo on the "new_rules" branch. Switch back to the master branch and pull down the latest changes and switch over to the "new_rules" branch.

If you take a look at the "dojo_rules.md" file, you'll notice we were a bit careless in our new rule – misspelling "coffee" and capitalizing "dojo" when it should be lowercase. Go ahead and fix both of these errors on the branch and push your changes up to GitHub also on the "new_rules" branch.

Your new commit should also now show up in the pull request we created. Once you've verified all of this, let us know by clicking "Submit Answer".
