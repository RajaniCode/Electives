1. Pull all the changes down from GitHub. Look at your git log and you’ll see the "new_rules" branch has been merged into master. After pulling it down, your "master" branch should be at the same state as the "master" branch on GitHub.

Merge the "deadly_skills" branch into master and push the changes to GitHub. You'll need to be on the "master" branch when you run the merge command.

After you push the "master" branch, you'll see that the pull request on the branch was closed.
