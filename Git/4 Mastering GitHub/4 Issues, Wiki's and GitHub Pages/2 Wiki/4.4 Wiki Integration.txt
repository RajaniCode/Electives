1. Make sure the Wiki feature is enabled for your "dojo_rules" repository. It was enabled in the "deadlyvipers/dojo_rules" repository, so it should be for yours as well.

Answer:

Ensure Wikis is checked


2. Our "README.md" file on the master branch of our "dojo_rules" repository isn't very helpful. Update "README.md" to mention that "All members should read the rules".

Also include a link back to the deadlyvipers organization which started it all ("https://github.com/deadlyvipers").

Feel free to include any other GitHub Flavored Markdown [https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/] as well.

3. Go to the wiki for your "dojo_rules" repository and create the the first page. On that page, we'll experiment with status badging by adding in a badge that shows the build status from Travis CI [https://travis-ci.org/] for the Arel project. This will show green when tests are passing for the Arel project, or red when they are not.

To add this badge, update the "Home" page of the wiki to include the following:

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/rails/arel.svg?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/rails/arel)
