7.3 Hub Clone

Ready to give hub a shot? We've aliased it to git, so we'll be able to use whichever one we prefer. For starters, clone down the deadlyvipers/dojo_rules repository without using a protocol (like http or ssh).


Type help to see the help menu

$ alias git=hub

 

$ hub clone deadlyvipers/dojo_rules

Congratulations, you're correct!
