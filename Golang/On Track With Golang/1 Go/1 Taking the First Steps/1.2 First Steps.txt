1.2 First Steps

Throughout many of the challenges in this course, we'll be building a CLI (command-line) chat application using concepts learned along the way. This chat app will allow us to talk to our gopher friends living underground. Let’s start with the basics.


1. As the very first thing in the source code file, define the package that all runnable Go programs must have.

Answer: 
chat/main.go
package main

2. Next, import the package responsible for printing to the console.

Answer: import "fmt"
chat/main.go
package main

import "fmt"

3. Define the function that is the entry point for all Go programs. Remember, it must have a specific name.

Answer: 
chat/main.go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {}

4. From inside the main function, call the proper function from the fmt module to output the following text to the console: "Gopher chat".

Answer:
chat/main.go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
  fmt.Println("Gopher chat")
}
