1.10 The Time Is Now

Our friend reached out to us again asking for help. She is writing another program in Go but can't figure out what is causing a build error. We quickly notice she is missing not one, but two package imports on the chat/main.go file.

main.go
package main

func main() {
  fmt.Println("The time now is", time.Now())
}

Using the console, run a command that fixes this issue for us. Remember to use the flag that writes the output of the command back to the original source file.


$ goimports -w chat/main.go

Success!
