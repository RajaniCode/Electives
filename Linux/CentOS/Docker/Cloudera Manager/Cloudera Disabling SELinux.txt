Disabling SELinux

Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) allows you to set access control through policies. You must disable SELinux on each host before you deploy CDH on your cluster.

To disable SELinux, perform the following steps on each host.

Check the SELinux state.

getenforce

If the output is either permissive or disabled, you can skip this task and go to Disabling the Firewall. If the output is enforcing, continue to the next step.
Open the /etc/selinux/config file (in some systems, the /etc/sysconfig/selinux file).
Change the line SELINUX=enforcing to SELINUX=permissive.
Save and close the file.
Restart your system or run the following command to disable SELinux immediately:

setenforce 0
