Cluster Installation

Select Repository

Cloudera recommends the use of parcels for installation over packages, because parcels enable Cloudera Manager to easily manage the software on your cluster, automating the deployment and upgrade of service binaries. Electing not to use parcels will require you to manually upgrade packages on all hosts in your cluster when software updates are available, and will prevent you from using Cloudera Manager's rolling upgrade capabilities.
