Enterprise Linux and Fedora

Including Red Hat® Enterprise Linux® / RHEL, CentOS and Fedora.

Node.js is available from the NodeSource [https://nodesource.com/] Enterprise Linux and Fedora binary distributions repository. Support for this repository, along with its scripts, can be found on GitHub at nodesource/distributions [https://github.com/nodesource/distributions].

Note that the Node.js packages for EL 5 (RHEL5 and CentOS 5) depend on the EPEL repository being available. The setup script will check and provide instructions if it is not installed.

curl --silent --location https://rpm.nodesource.com/setup_4.x | bash -

curl --silent --location https://rpm.nodesource.com/setup_5.x | bash -

Then install, as root:

yum -y install nodejs
