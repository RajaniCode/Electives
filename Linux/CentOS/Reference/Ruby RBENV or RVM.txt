What is better RBENV or RVM?
rbenv is a new lightweight Ruby version management tool built by Sam Stephenson (of 37signals and Prototype.js fame). The established leader in the Ruby version management scene is RVM but rbenv is an interesting alternative if you want or need something significantly lighter with fewer features.
