System Requirements

Java Development Kit (JDK) 	Maven 3.3 requires JDK 1.7 or above to execute - it still allows you to build against 1.3 and other JDK versions by Using Toolchains[http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-using-toolchains.html]

Memory 	No minimum requirement
Disk 	Approximately 10MB is required for the Maven installation itself. In addition to that, additional disk space will be used for your local Maven repository. The size of your local repository will vary depending on usage but expect at least 500MB.
Operating System 	No minimum requirement. Start up scripts are included as shell scripts and Windows batch files.

Files

Maven is distributed in several formats for your convenience. Simply pick a ready-made binary distribution archive and follow the installation instructions [http://maven.apache.org/install.html]. Use a source archive if you intend to build Maven yourself.

In order to guard against corrupted downloads/installations, it is highly recommended to verify the signature[https://www.apache.org/dev/release-signing#verifying-signature] of the release bundles against the public KEYS [https://www.apache.org/dist/maven/KEYS] used by the Apache Maven developers.
