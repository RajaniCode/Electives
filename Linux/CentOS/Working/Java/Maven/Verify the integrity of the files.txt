Verify the integrity of the files

It is essential that you verify the integrity of the downloaded file using the PGP signature (.asc file) or a hash (.md5 or .sha file). Please read Verifying Apache Software Foundation Releases for more information on why you should verify our releases.

The PGP signature can be verified using PGP or GPG. First download the KEYS as well as the asc signature file for the relevant distribution. Make sure you get these files from the main distribution site, rather than from a mirror. Then verify the signatures using

% gpg --import KEYS
% gpg --verify downloaded_file.asc downloaded_file

or

% pgpk -a KEYS
% pgpv downloaded_file.asc

or

% pgp -ka KEYS
% pgp downloaded_file.asc

Alternatively, you can verify the MD5 hash on the file. A unix program called md5 or md5sum is included in many unix distributions. It is also available as part of GNU Textutils. Windows users can get binary md5 programs from here, here , or here.
