The MongoDB instance stores its data files in /var/lib/mongo and its log files in /var/log/mongodb by default, and runs using the mongod user account. You can specify alternate log and data file directories in /etc/mongod.conf. See systemLog.path and storage.dbPath for additional information.

If you change the user that runs the MongoDB process, you must modify the access control rights to the /var/lib/mongo and /var/log/mongodb directories to give this user access to these directories.
