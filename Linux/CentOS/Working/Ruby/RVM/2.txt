Upgrade Notes:


  * Please do NOT forget to add your users to the 'rvm' group.
    The installer no longer auto-adds root or users to the rvm group. Admins must do this.
    Also, please note that group memberships are ONLY evaluated at login time.
    This means that users must log out then back in before group membership takes effect!
