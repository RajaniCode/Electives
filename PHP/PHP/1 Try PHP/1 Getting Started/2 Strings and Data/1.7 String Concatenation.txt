1.7 String Concatenation

Let's combine strings with variables.

index.php

<?php
$city = 'Tokyo';
$established = 1868;
$country = 'Japan';

?>
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/master.css" media="screen">
    <title>Try PHP</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="sidebar">
        <div class="info">
          <ul>
            <li><?php echo $city; ?></li>
            <li>Country: <?php echo $country; ?></li>
            <li>Established: <?php echo $established; ?></li>
            
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="details">
          <p></p>
          <p></p>
          <p>It officially became the capital after Emperor Meiji
            moved his seat to the city from the old capital of
            Kyoto.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

?>
<!DOCTYPE html>

  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="sidebar">
        <div class="info">

        <div class="details">
          <p><?php echo "$city has a very high population"; ?></p>
          <p></p>
          <p>It officially became the capital after Emperor Meiji
            moved his seat to the city from the old capital of
            Kyoto.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

2. In the second new paragraph tag, create the following sentence: 'Tokyo is the capital of Japan and was established in 1868.' using the variables and string evaluation.

Answer:
index.php

<?php
$city = 'Tokyo';
$established = 1868;
$country = 'Japan';

?>
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/master.css" media="screen">
    <title>Try PHP</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="sidebar">
        <div class="info">
          <ul>
            <li><?php echo $city; ?></li>
            <li>Country: <?php echo $country; ?></li>
            <li>Established: <?php echo $established; ?></li>
            
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="details">
          <p><?php echo "$city has a very high population"; ?></p>
          <p><?php echo "$city is the capital of $country and was established in $established."; ?></p>
          <p>It officially became the capital after Emperor Meiji
            moved his seat to the city from the old capital of
            Kyoto.</p>
        </div>
