3.7 Which Function?

Which built-in PHP function would we use to validate an email that matches a format standard?

[Single Answer]

FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL
email
filter_email
filter_var


Answer: filter_var
Note:
FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL
This is actually the constant that we want to use as an argument in the answer of filter_var.
email
Once we have added a custom library, this might work, but it is not built-in to PHP.
