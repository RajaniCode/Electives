5.7 Assert or Validate

When we want to have the Validator class throw a custom exception when the validation fails, would we use the assert method or the validate method?

[Single Answer]

validate
assert


Answer: assert
Note:
validate
The validate method returns a boolean type on failure. We really want to assert.
