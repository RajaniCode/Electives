1.10 Update

We can also write code to update data in a datastore, so let's practice one way of retrieving a single piece of data, updating it, and saving it back to the datastore.

app.php
<?php

use App\Farm;


1. Using the find method, find a farm with the ID of 3 and store it in a variable called $farm.

Answer
app.php
<?php

use App\Farm;
$farm = Farm::find(3);


2. Create an array named $data with the following key value pairs:

name: Thompson Farms,
city: Thomasville, and
website: thompsonfarms.com.

Answer
app.php
<?php

use App\Farm;
$farm = Farm::find(3);
$data = [
'name' => 'Thompson Farms',
'city' => 'Thomasville',
'website' => 'thompsonfarms.com'
];

3. Using the $data array and the fill method on the $farm object, update the information in the $farm variable.

Answer
app.php
<?php

use App\Farm;
$farm = Farm::find(3);
$data = [
'name' => 'Thompson Farms',
'city' => 'Thomasville',
'website' => 'thompsonfarms.com'
];
$farm->fill($data);
