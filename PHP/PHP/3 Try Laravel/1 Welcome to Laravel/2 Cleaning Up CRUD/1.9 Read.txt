We've added some data to the Farms datastore, so now let's practice reading it back.

app.php

<?php

use App\Farm;


1. Using the all static method, store all of the farms in a variable called $farms.

Answer
app.php

<?php

use App\Farm;
$farms = Farm::all();

2. Next, using a foreach loop, cycle through each farm in the $farms collection and echo the name property each time.

Answer
app.php

<?php

use App\Farm;
$farms = Farm::all(); 
foreach ($farms as $farm) {
 echo $farm->name;
}
