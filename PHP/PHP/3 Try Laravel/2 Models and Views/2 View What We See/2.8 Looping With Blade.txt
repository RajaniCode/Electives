2.8 Looping With Blade

Data is often returned from a datastore as an array of values, and there's a special syntax in the Blade templating engine for looping through data.
 
resources/views/farms/index.blade.php
<h1>Farms</h1>

<ul>
  
</ul>


1. Using blade syntax, create a @foreach loop that loops through all $farms and stores each one as a variable named $farm.

Answer
resources/views/farms/index.blade.php
<h1>Farms</h1>
<ul>
@foreach($farms as $farm)

@endforeach
</ul>

2. Inside of that @foreach, create an <li> tag that contains the name of the $farm.

Answer
resources/views/farms/index.blade.php
<h1>Farms</h1>
<ul>
@foreach($farms as $farm)
    <li>
    {{ $farm->name }}
    </li>
@endforeach
</ul>
