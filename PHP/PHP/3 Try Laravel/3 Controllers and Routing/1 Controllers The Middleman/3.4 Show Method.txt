3.4 Show Method

One common method to add to a controller is show(), which will be called whenever a user requests information about a specific piece of data from the datastore (in this case, a farm).

app/Http/Controllers/FarmController.php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use App\Farm;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;

class FarmController extends Controller
{
  public function index()
  {
    $farms = Farm::all();
    return view('farms.index', ['farms' => $farms]);
  }

  

}


1. On the lines below the index method, create a new method named show that has a single parameter named $farm with the class of Farm.

Answer
app/Http/Controllers/FarmController.php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use App\Farm;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;

class FarmController extends Controller
{
  public function index()
  {
    $farms = Farm::all();
    return view('farms.index', ['farms' => $farms]);
  }

  public function show(Farm $farm)
  {
    
  }

}

2. In show(), since the injection in the argument will get our object for us, simply return a view with the template of 'farms.show' and pass along the $farm object as an array with the key of 'farm'.

Answer
app/Http/Controllers/FarmController.php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use App\Farm;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;

class FarmController extends Controller
{
  public function index()
  {
    $farms = Farm::all();
    return view('farms.index', ['farms' => $farms]);
  }

  public function show(Farm $farm)
  {
    return view('farms.show', ['farm' => $farm]);
  }

}
