3.7 Closures With Arguments

Using the first closure in web.php as an example, let's write another route that accepts an argument. This will fix our preview so that it shows the farm number we're requesting when we visit the farms/1 route.

routes/web.php
<?php

Route::get('/', function() {
  return "this is the home page";
});


1. Create a closure route — similar to the '/' route — for 'farms/' and pass along an ID argument named $id.

Answer
routes/web.php
<?php

Route::get('/', function() {
  return "this is the home page";
});

Route::get('farms/{id}' , function($id) {
});

2. Now from that route, return a string that says "The id requested is $id".

Answer
routes/web.php
<?php

Route::get('/', function() {
  return "this is the home page";
});

Route::get('farms/{id}' , function($id) {
  return "The id requested is $id";
});
