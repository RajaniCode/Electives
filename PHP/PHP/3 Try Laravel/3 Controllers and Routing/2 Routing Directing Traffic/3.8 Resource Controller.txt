3.8 Resource Controller

Let's refactor some of our routes to use resource and controller routes.

routes/web.php
<?php
 
Route::get('/', function() {
  return "this is the home page";
} );

Route::get('farms/{id}', function($id) {
  return "The id requested is $id";
});


1. First, replace the closure in the '/' route with a string that refers to the FarmController index method.

Answer
routes/web.php
<?php
 
Route::get('/', 'FarmController@index');

Route::get('farms/{id}', function($id) {
  return "The id requested is $id";
});

2. Now replace the second closure route with a resource() route for the FarmController with a base url of 'farms'.

Answer
routes/web.php
<?php
 
Route::get('/', 'FarmController@index');

Route::resource('farms', 'FarmController');
