2.2 MySQL Monitor

In order for us to run our migrations, we will need to first create a new database. We'll do this using the MySQL monitor command line interface.


1. To get started, enter the monitor using the command mysql followed by a -u and the user root. Also, add the -p flag so that MySQL will prompt us for a password (we'll fill it in automatically for you).

Answer
$ mysql -u root -p

2. Now that we are in the monitor, let's run the SQL statement to create a new database named market.

Answer
mysql> create database market;


# Note
$ mysql -u root -p
Enter password: [codeschool]
