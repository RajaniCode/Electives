2.6 Mass Assignment

We ran into mass assignment exceptions when we created our markets, so let's fix this before it becomes an issue with the farms table.

app/Farm.php
<?php

namespace App;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class Farm extends Model
{
  
}


Using the model property $fillable, add the names of our columns 'name', 'city', and 'website' as an array, and mark that variable as protected.

Answer
