2.4 Social Shipmates

We've noticed that the majority of potential shipmates use Twitter. We want to allow shipmates to post about their experiences on the voyage. Let's construct a pattern to validate that each potential shipmate has entered a valid Twitter URL.

To begin, let's match 'http' followed by a colon ':'.

Continue by adding two forward slash literals '//' after the colon. Don't forget that forward slashes are a special character that needs to be escaped!

Next add the 'www' portion of our URL and include a dot literal '.' after the 'www' pattern.

Next add the literal 'twitter'.

Now add the '.com' portion of our pattern.

Finally, add a slash literal '/' and the username portion of the twitter URL. This can be any name consisting of one or more word characters.
