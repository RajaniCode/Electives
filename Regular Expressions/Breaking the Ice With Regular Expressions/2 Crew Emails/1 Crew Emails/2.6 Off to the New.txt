2.6 Off to the New

We only wish to visit destinations that begin with the word 'new'. All older places will be left off of our voyage. For example, New England, New Zealand, etc…

Using an anchor and a lowercase literal 'new', construct a pattern that matches 'new' only if there is not any text before the 'new' portion in our destinations. Also add the modifier that will make the pattern 'case insensitive'.

Finish off the pattern by matching the remaining destination name using a character set - this character set should be repeated 1 or more times and use a range from a-z and a whitespace character.
