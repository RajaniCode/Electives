2.7 A Fork in the Path

We have many different tools to choose from for our journey, and we want to construct a pattern that matches several of them. While constructing our pattern, we only want to only use 1 axe literal.

Start by creating a pattern using literals to match 'battle axe'.

Now let's add to our pattern a group and another axe, the 'splitting axe'. Remember, we can only have one 'axe' literal.

Finally, lets add the 'pickaxe'. Take note that there is not a space between 'pick' and 'axe'.
