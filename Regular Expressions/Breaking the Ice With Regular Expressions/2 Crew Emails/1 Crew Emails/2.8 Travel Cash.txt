2.8 Travel Cash

As each potential shipmate is signing up, we want to know how much cash they will be bringing on the trip. We can use a regular expression to make sure they have entered a valid currency amount.

Let's start by matching the dollars portion of our subject (the numbers before the decimal). Here we can have 1 or more numbers that range from 0 to 9. We will want to only use a character set to match the possible amount of dollars a shipmate may bring.

Great. Now let's add the decimal point and some numbers to match cents. Keep in mind that we want exactly two numbers for cents.

Lastly, let's add the dollar sign to the beginning of the pattern to indicate the currency.
