3.3 Superstitious Sailors

As it turns out, our potential shipmates are extremely superstitious. As such, we do not want anyone to enter certain words in their comments.

Let's start checking for bad words within a sentence. We can begin with 'sink' as our first bad word. We will want to make sure this word is by itself and not part of a larger word.

Looking good, but there are more bad words we need to account for. Let's also check for 'wreck'.

Almost finished. Our final bad word to match is 'disaster'.

Subjects

If we wreck, can we turn around?
