3.4 Escaping to the Coordinates

We just received a list of coordinates consisting of the latitude and longitude of our potential destinations. We will need to validate that each coordinate follows a known pattern.

To begin, we know that the coordinate can be a positive or negative number. Add a - character that is matched 0 to 1 time, followed by a single digit 1 or more times.

Since latitudes and longitudes are decimals, we will add the ., or dot literal, to account for the decimal place.

Lastly, add the final portion of the pattern to match any amount of numbers after the decimal point.
