3.5 Becoming More Social

We have a pattern to validate a shipmate's Twitter URL. However, after a few examples are validated, we see a few issues with our pattern.

First off, our pattern should accept either 'http' or 'https' in the URL. Update the pattern to allow for an optional 's' in the first part of the URL.

Next, that 'www.' at the front needs to optional too - so update the pattern.

Finally, let's match several different combinations of our top level domain. We will want to match '.com' and '.org'.
