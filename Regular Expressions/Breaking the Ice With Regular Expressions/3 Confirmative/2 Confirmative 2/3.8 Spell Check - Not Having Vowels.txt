3.8 Spell Check - Not Having Vowels

Ever since Mute Morris lost his tongue, he’s been saying some weird things – and no longer pronouncing vowels. Since we know that most English words contain vowels, we can generate a pattern to search for words that do not contain vowels and consider them misspelled.

Using a character set repeated 1 or more times, make a pattern to search for strings that do not contain the characters 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', and 'y'.

Next, surround our pattern with a word boundary on each side.

But wait, our pattern is considering strings containing white space to be misspelled words. Add the white space to the characters we wish to not match.
