4.5 Mapping the United States

We have decided to voyage to each state within the United States of America and have a large text file containing all of the states. We will need to search through the entire text file and ensure that the names of the states follow a certain pattern.

Some state names have 2 words. Create a pattern that will match the first word within a two-word state name. A two-word state name can begin with 'new', 'north', 'south', 'west', and 'rhode'. We also want to match on both upper and lower case characters.
