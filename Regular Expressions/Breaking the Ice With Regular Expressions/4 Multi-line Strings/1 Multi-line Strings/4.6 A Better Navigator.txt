4.6 A Better Navigator

We already made a pattern to validate coordinates for our voyage, specifically the latitude and longitude. Now we have a better navigator and we are better at regular expressions. Let's create a pattern that validates multiple coordinates in a large text file.

Each number can be positive or negative, so add an optional dash literal followed by a number that can be between 1 and 3 characters in length. Do not use a character set to match numbers.

Next, add the decimal place (dot literal) followed by a number repeated 1 or more times. Do not use a character set to match numbers.

Great, now match every coordinate in the file - not just the first one found.

Finally, let's ensure there is nothing before or after our coordinate on each line. Keep in mind that this is a multi-line string.
