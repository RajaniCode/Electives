5.5 The Punch Card

We're paying our crew in treasure, and we are asking them to enter the date and time that they start and end their shift. The required format is 'mm/dd/yyyy hh:mm'. We'll need to store the entire date and time along with just the time separately.

Start by capturing the entire pattern using a group.

Next, capture just the hour and minute portion of the subject using another group.

The group used to evaluate either '2015' or '2016' is being returned to us - but that's not what we want. Modify this group so that it does not capture the year.
